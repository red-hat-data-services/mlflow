# Fork History

Rebase log for the OpenDataHub MLflow fork (opendatahub-io/mlflow).

Each rebase section records which downstream commits were kept, dropped, or squashed,
and how merge conflicts were resolved.

## Recurring post-rebase issues

These break CI after every rebase. Fix them proactively before pushing.

1. **i18n key drift** — Conflict resolution keeps i18n entries from both sides, but some upstream keys reference components removed in the same release. Run `cd mlflow/server/js && yarn i18n` to remove orphaned keys from `en.json`.

2. **`UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER` env var** — `.github/actions/setup-python/action.yml` hardcodes `UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER=P7D`. ODH needs `P14D` (matching `pyproject.toml`). The env var overrides the config file, causing `uv lock` drift in the version-sync CI check. Update it after every rebase.

3. **Conftest lint for composite actions** — The repo's conftest policy forbids `${{ }}` interpolation directly in `run:` blocks of composite actions. ODH files (e.g., `.github/actions/build-image/action.yml`) may violate this. Move values to `env:` blocks.

4. **Typo checker on git hashes** — `FORK_HISTORY.md` is excluded from the typos checker in `pyproject.toml` because git hashes trigger false positives. If the exclusion is lost during a rebase conflict on `pyproject.toml`, re-add it.

5. **`uv` version pinning** — `.github/actions/setup-python/action.yml` pins a `uv` version. Verify it matches `pyproject.toml`'s `required-version`. Mismatches cause `uv lock` output to differ between local and CI.

6. **Prettier formatting** — Pre-commit uses **prettier v2** (pinned in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`). Do NOT use `npx prettier` (installs v3, formats differently). Use `uv run pre-commit run prettier --files <file>` instead.

### Conflict resolutions

**Scaffolding commit (~30 conflicts):**

All modify/delete — upstream-only CI workflows that ODH intentionally deletes. Resolved with `git rm`. Content conflict in `.github/workflows/master.yml`: removed upstream Databricks test step.

**Backend commit:**

Dropped as empty by git — `uv.lock` and `pyproject.toml` changes were already superseded by v3.14.0. Files that were grouped into this commit (CSS audit scripts, rebase skill files, PatternFly README) were recovered from `odh/master` via step 10b.

**UI commit (4 content conflicts):**

- `ExperimentViewHeader.tsx` — upstream added `headerActionsHidden` conditional wrapping; ODH added `!isEmbedded` guard on docs link. Merged both.
- `ExperimentPageTabs.tsx` — upstream renamed `showExperimentPageSideNav` to `enableWorkflowBasedNavigation` and added `headerHidden`. Took upstream's version.
- `en.json` — both sides added i18n keys. Took from `odh/master`, synced with `yarn i18n`.
- `yarn.lock` — took from `odh/master`.

### Post-rebase fixes

- Recovered 20 downstream files silently dropped when backend commit was skipped
- Restored ODH-specific `package.json` entries (PatternFly, module federation, audit scripts, Playwright)
- Added upstream v3.14.0 Monaco editor dependencies (3 packages)
- Synced i18n keys (2,092 new keys from v3.14.0, 32 orphaned removed)
- Re-added `FORK_HISTORY.md` typos exclusion in `pyproject.toml`
- Added top-level `permissions: {}` to 7 ODH workflows (conftest policy)
- Updated CSS override verified versions
- Updated rebase skill with step 10b (dropped-file detection)
- Gated Playground tab and route behind `shouldEnableAIGateway()` — Playground requires the AI Gateway backend, so it should be hidden when `MLFLOW_ENABLE_AI_GATEWAY=false`
- Passed MLflow version override (`SUPPORTED_MLFLOW_VERSION_OVERRIDE`) to the operator CI build to resolve the chicken-and-egg version mismatch during rebase PRs

### Conflict resolutions

#### Scaffolding commit (3 content conflicts)

- **`.github/workflows/master.yml`**: Upstream added a "Run GenAI Tests (Databricks)" step. Removed it — ODH does not run Databricks-specific tests.
- **`pyproject.toml`** (`[tool.uv]`): Upstream changed `exclude-newer` to `P7D` and bumped `required-version` to `>=0.11.14`. Kept ODH's `P14D` window and extra `exclude-newer-package` entries (`mlflow-kubernetes-plugins`, `starlette`), but took upstream's `required-version = ">=0.11.14"`.
- **`uv.lock`**: Took ODH's `P14D` exclude-newer-span.

15 modify/delete conflicts were resolved by deleting the files (upstream workflows ODH intentionally removes).

Additionally, `slow-tests.yml` (Docker model serving tests) and `helm.yml` (Helm chart tests) were deleted from the fork scaffolding — these test upstream-only features not used in ODH and their flaky failures added noise to CI validation.

#### UI commit (9 content conflicts)

- **`mlflow/environment_variables.py`**: Both sides added new env vars in the same location. Kept both — upstream's `MLFLOW_RBAC_SEED_DEFAULT_ROLES` and ODH's `MLFLOW_ENABLE_ASSISTANT` / `MLFLOW_ENABLE_AI_GATEWAY`.
- **`mlflow/server/handlers.py`**: Upstream renamed `_validate_artifact_root_uri` → `_validate_storage_location_uri`. Kept upstream's rename and added ODH's `_disable_gateway` decorator above it.
- **`mlflow/server/js/craco.config.js`**: Upstream added `preservePdfjsBundles`, ODH added `suppressAutoprefixerWarnings`. Kept both.
- **`mlflow/server/js/src/MlflowRouter.tsx`**: Upstream added account/admin route imports. Kept them and wrapped gateway routes with ODH's `shouldEnableAIGateway()` feature flag.
- **`mlflow/server/js/src/common/components/MlflowSidebar.tsx`**: Upstream added `useActiveWorkspace`, ODH added `isAssistantEnabled`. Kept both imports.
- **`mlflow/server/js/src/common/forms/validations.ts`**: Upstream had detailed error handling with `isResourceDoesNotExistError`. Kept ODH's simplified version (catch → name available). Removed dead `isResourceDoesNotExistError` function and unused `ErrorCodes` import.
- **`mlflow/server/js/src/experiment-tracking/.../ExperimentViewHeader.tsx`**: Upstream added `formatTraceArchivalRetentionForDisplay`, ODH added `MlflowSidebarWorkflowSwitch`. Kept both imports.
- **`mlflow/server/js/src/lang/default/en.json`**: Two conflicts where upstream added new i18n entries. Kept entries from both sides in correct sort order.
- **`mlflow/server/js/src/workspaces/utils/WorkspaceUtils.ts`**: Upstream refactored to `useSyncExternalStore` pattern (`activeWorkspaceListeners`). ODH has `onWorkspaceChange` callback for Redux store dispatch. Kept both subscription patterns; `setActiveWorkspace` notifies both listener sets.

### Post-rebase fixes

**CI fixes:**

- **`.github/actions/setup-python/action.yml`**: `UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER=P7D` env var overrode `pyproject.toml`'s `P14D`, causing `uv lock` drift. Fixed to `P14D`.
- **`en.json`**: Removed orphaned i18n key `RgVN+O` (upstream component removed in v3.13.0).
- **`.github/actions/build-image/action.yml`**: Moved `${{ }}` interpolations to `env:` blocks for conftest lint compliance.
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Added `FORK_HISTORY.md` to typos checker `extend-exclude`.
- **`validations.test.ts`**: Updated test to match ODH's simplified error handling (`callback(undefined)` on any API error instead of upstream's specific error message).

**UI fixes found during visual verification:**

- **`_scope-and-base-controls.scss`**: Removed global `align-self: center` from button override — it fought with form layouts (tags modal `+` button misaligned with inputs) and control bars (`+ New run` misaligned with kebab icon). Replaced with targeted `align-items: center` on the prompts detail action bar container only.

### Late additions to master (merged after initial rebase)

- **PR #281** (`25ffd0263`): `keep: Use sentence case for experiment and prompt UI labels` — merged to master after the rebase was prepared. Integrated via a second `merge -s ours` to link the updated master into the rebase branch.

### Notes

- 5 downstream commits were missing the required `keep:`/`drop:` prefix: `05ebb6685`, `2284d44b8`, `3e9892995`, `b4d3741f3`, `e45541f73`. All were ODH-specific and included in the appropriate squash category.
- The `backport:` prefix on `55be94684` is treated as a `drop:` since the original commit is in v3.13.0.
- Draft PRs skip most CI workflows due to `if: draft == false` guards. The CI validation PR must be created as a normal (non-draft) PR with a `[DO NOT MERGE]` title.
